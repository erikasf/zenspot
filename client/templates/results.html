				<h4>15th Floor</h4>
				<p>This rooftop garden is all the way up on the 15th floor — you read that right, the 15th floor. It’s epic. If you walk along the edges of the space there are some incredible views, because, of course, you are 15 floors up. We can’t get over it.</p>

				<h4>FREE WIFI</h4>
				<p>This rooftop garden is a popular lunch spot; although you’ll find it full of people on a weekday at lunchtime, there is still plenty of seating. Tables, chairs, and benches are scattered throughout the space, and the collection of flowers, bushes, and trees is extensive. </p>

				<h4>(Entrance at 23 Geary Blvd.)</h4>
				<p>Although this rooftop terrace features some benches to sit on, the real reason to come here is to marvel at the city bellow you. The 11th floor terrace may be small, but it has some spectacular views.</p>

				<h4>6th floor.</h4>
				<p>This garden terrace is ideal for a quiet meal; only a few people come up to it during their lunch hour, so it’s rarely crowded. The terrace includes an assortment of flowers, and the large metal arch gives the space some character.</p>
