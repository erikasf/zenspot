I can't believe I've walked by this little hidden gem so many times without noticing it.  It is a beautiful space.  Great plants.  Great art.  I would truly love to see it at night with the strung lights.  It is just beautiful.</p>
<p>
It is honestly a huge triumph to build something so pretty..</p>

</h4>
		
    <p>Crocker Galleria's best sale is probably found on its rooftop terrace. It is actually two rooftops that have been turned into a maze of greenery and hidden spots to sit and enjoy nature in the  middle of the hustle and bustle of san francisco. </p>
